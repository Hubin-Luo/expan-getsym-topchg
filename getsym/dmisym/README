output:
   central position      
   relative vector     DMI vector

steps:
(1) obtain all DMI vectors around the considered central positions
    within given distance
    input:
       number-of-inequivalent-DMI-vectors
	central position   relative vector    DMI vector
	central position   ....
	...
    print the result for check

(2) do symmetry operation to get all DMI vectors around other positions
